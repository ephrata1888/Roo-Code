 * OutputInterceptor buffers terminal command output and spills to disk when threshold exceeded.
 *
 * This implements a "persisted output" pattern where large command outputs are saved to disk
 * files, with only a preview shown to the LLM. The LLM can then use the `read_command_output`
 * tool to retrieve full contents or search through the output.
 *
 * The interceptor uses a **head/tail buffer** strategy (inspired by Codex):
 * - 50% of the preview budget is allocated to the "head" (beginning of output)
 * - 50% of the preview budget is allocated to the "tail" (end of output)
 * - Middle content is dropped when output exceeds the preview threshold
 *
 * This approach ensures the LLM sees both:
 * - The beginning (command startup, environment info, early errors)
 * - The end (final results, exit codes, error summaries)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const interceptor = new OutputInterceptor({
 *   executionId: Date.now().toString(),
 *   taskId: 'task-123',
 *   command: 'npm test',
 *   storageDir: '/path/to/task/command-output',
 *   previewSize: 'medium',
 * });
 *
 * // Write output chunks as they arrive
 * interceptor.write('Running tests...\n');
 * interceptor.write('Test 1 passed\n');
 *
 * // Finalize and get the result
 * const result = interceptor.finalize();
 * // result.preview contains head + [omitted] + tail for display
 * // result.artifactPath contains path to full output if truncated
 * ```
